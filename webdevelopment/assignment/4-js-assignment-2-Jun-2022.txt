1. Write a java script program to
calculate discount amount and net amount 
to pay based on following advertisement
by an ecommerce company.

purchare amount <=10000
discount = 10 %
purchare amount >10000 and  purchare amount <=20000
discount = 20 %
purchare amount >20000 and  purchare amount <=30000
discount = 30 %
purchare amount >30000
discount = 35 %

2. Electricity bill payment
Units consumed <=100 - Pay 1 Rs/Unit
Units consumed >100 && <=200 - Pay 2 Rs/Unit
Units consumed >200 && <=300 - Pay 3 Rs/Unit
Units consumed >300 - Pay 5 Rs/Unit

Calculation is cumulative
Sample calculation 
50 units - 50 X 1 = 50
150 units - 100 X 1 + 50 X 2 = 200
